How it all started? - https://medium.com/@haely.shah/model-centric-to-data-centric-mlops-pt-1-50b52b128c65

The goal is to build a reusable pipeline from start to finish. While we do have tools (KubeFlow?) that already do the job, my main goal here is writing a 'only python' easy to use, first draft code for the pipeline
Main steps I am working in the first phase of my code - 
- Read data (get the features and stats)
- Clean the data
- Preprocess the data
- Run a model
- Evaluation
